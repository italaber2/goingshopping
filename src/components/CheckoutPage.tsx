// ChatGPT Feedback:
//     Component Naming: The component name CheckoutPage accurately represents its purpose.

//     Content: The content inside the component provides a confirmation message about the user's purchase. It might be helpful to use template literals or string interpolation to display the dynamic values (number of items and total price) in the message.

//     CSS Classes: The use of the App and App-header classes suggests that you're reusing styling from the App component. Consider whether you want the checkout page to have a different styling from the main application page.

//     Semantic HTML: Similar to the App component, you might consider using semantic HTML elements like <header> and <article> to better structure your content.

//     Content Customization: The message "You've purchased X items for a total of XX.XX. Goodbye!" is clear, but you might want to provide more context about the items and total amount.

//     Content Formatting: If displaying currency, consider formatting it consistently using methods like toLocaleString() to enhance readability.
